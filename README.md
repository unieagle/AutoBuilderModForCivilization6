# Auto Builder for Civilization 6 (or Civ VI)
by uniEagle

## Features

This MOD will populate the previous Unit, Project it just completed for you, if they are still available to be built;

Or populates the avaiable Building or District if they did not need your placement.

## Purpose

When our empire has large amount of cities or in the late stage of game, the buiding item selection panel becomes a problem.

It keeps poping up, but we really dont care about what's next.

e.g.

1. in the late stage, we just want the cities keep on the money project;
2. in newly acquired cities, we just want it to keep fixing those damaged buildings;
3. in newly created cities, we just want it to build those available building to catch up with other cities.

## Install

1. Download the [package](https://github.com/unieagle/AutoBuilderModForCivilization6/archive/master.zip), unzip and place it in your DLC directory or Mods directory.
2. Copy the `AutoBuilder.lua` into the game's `Assets/UI/Panels` directory. (This is for making the separated lua script to be loaded, if you know the better way, please let me know)
3. In the game, make sure checked this MOD.
